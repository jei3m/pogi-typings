**Pogi Typings Generator** is a simple website created using React JS, integrated with Gemini AI for grammar correction and punctuation. This project was developed as an experiment to explore and test the capabilities of the AI's system instructions.

## Features

- **React JS**: Utilizes the powerful front-end library React JS for building user interfaces.
- **Gemini AI Integration**: Automatically corrects grammar and punctuation in real-time using the advanced capabilities of Gemini AI.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to experiment with and understand how AI can be integrated into web applications, particularly focusing on grammar correction and punctuation. Through this project, I aimed to explore the practical applications and limitations of AI-driven text correction.
